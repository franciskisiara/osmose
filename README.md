An elegant way to filter your eloquent collections 

## Getting Started
To pull osmose in your project, use the command

```
composer require agog/osmose
```

## Defining Osmose Filters
Osmose provides an artisan command `make-filter` that accepts the name of the filter to be generated, which quickly scaffolds a filter class

```
php artisan osmose:make-filter CharacterFilter
```
A <code>CharacterFilter.php</code> file will be created in the `App\Http\Filters` namespace.

***NB: The Filters folder will be automatically created if it does not exist.***

A filter class extends the `Agog\Osmose\Library\OsmoseFilter` template and implements the `Agog\Osmose\Library\Services\Contracts\OsmoseFilterInterface` interface.

It must define a <code>residue</code> method that returns an array defining the filtration rules

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Filters;

use Agog\Osmose\Library\OsmoseFilter;
use Agog\Osmose\Library\Services\Contracts\OsmoseFilterInterface;

class CharacterFilter extends OsmoseFilter implements OsmoseFilterInterface
{
    /**
     * defines the form elements that are to be sieved
     * @return array
     */
    public function residue()
    {
        return [

        ];
    }
}
```

## Usage
In order to use the osmose filter, you define rules as an array within the residue method's

Rules are defined as key => value pairs with the key representing the parameter passed as the request and the value represents the rule construct.

Rules are defined based on the type of filter driver intended. Osmose presents three internal filter drivers 

    1. Agog\Osmose\Library\Drivers\DirectFilter
    2. Agog\Osmose\Library\Drivers\CallbackFilter
    3. Agog\Osmose\Library\Drivers\RelationshipFilter

In our business logic, we call Osmose's sieve method on the filter object and pass the eloquent class that we intend to filter
The sieve method will return Eloquent's builder.

`CharacterController.php` <br>
```php
public function index (CharacterFilter $filter)
{
    $characters = $filter->sieve(Character::class)->get();
}
```

----------

Consider the following tables and their related eloquent models

`Character.php` <br>

| id   | name        | gender  |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 1    | Baraka      | male    |
| 2    | Cassie Cage | female  |
| 3    | D'Vorah     | female  |
| 4    | Geras       | male    |
| 5    | Cetrion     | female  |

----------

`Role.php` <br>

| id   | name        |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | hero        |
| 2    | villain     |
| 3    | god         |

----------

`CharacterRole.php` <br>

| id   | character_id   | role_id | 
|------|----------------|---------|
| 1    | 1              | 2       |
| 2    | 2              | 1       |
| 3    | 3              | 2       |
| 4    | 4              | 2       |
| 5    | 4              | 3       |
| 6    | 5              | 3       |

----------

### DirectFilter

To use the DirectFilter driver, we define the rule, prefixed with the word 'column'

```php
public function residue ()
{
    return [
        'character_id' => 'column:id'
    ]
}
```

Osmose will then look for the key 'character_id' within the request object and only return the result whose id matches the value passed

<code>/characters?character_id=1</code> 
Will return the character record with an id of '1'

<hr>

### RelationshipFilter

To use the RelationshipFilter driver, we define the rule, prefixed with the word 'relationship', giving the name of the relationship and the column that should be checked in the related table

```php
public function residue ()
{
    return [
        'role' => 'relationship:roles,name'
    ]
}
```
***NB: It is assumed a roles (belongsToMany) relationship exists in the Character model.***

Osmose will then look for the key 'role' within the request object and only return the result based on the rule definition

<code>/characters?role=god</code> 
Will return all characters with the role of 'god'

<hr>

### CallbackFilter

To use the CallbackFilter driver, we pass a callback that takes in the query builder and the value of the request as arguments. The callback must return the result of the builder

```php
public function residue ()
{
    return [
        'gender' => function ($query, $value) {

            return $query->where('gender', $value);

        }
    ]
}
```

Osmose will then look for the key 'gender' within the request object and only return results based on the callback

<code>/characters?gender=male</code> 
Will return all male characters

<hr>

## Filtering Dates

As of version 2.0.0, osmose has introduced three new methods to assist in date filtering. These methods are;

```php
public function column () : string
{
    return 'created_at';
}

public function range ()
{
    return 'range';
}

public function limits () : array
{
    return [
        'from'  => 'from',
        'to'    => 'to'
    ];
}
```

## The column() method

The `column()` method returns a string indicating the column to be filtered once the sieve method on the filter class is executed. It defaults to the `created_at` column. Simply override the method in your filter class, returning your desired column.

## The range() method

*To use this feature, you must publish osmose's configuration file by running;*

This method replaces the `range` property that was available in previous versions. It has a similar API, in which it returns the query parameter to be examined against, given predefined ranges within osmose's configuration file. Override the method to return an appropriate range string.

If the defined range does not exist within the <code>GET</code> parameters, then osmose will not execute the range functionality.

## The limits() method

The limits method refines date filtering within osmose by allowing one to configure request options. This methods returns an array with two keys `from` and `to` which indicate the request parameters. 

<!-- Starting from version 1.1.0, osmose includes a date filter that quickly lets you fetch records whose *created_at* timestamps fall between a certain date range.


```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Agog\Osmose\Providers\OsmoseServiceProvider"
```

This will publish an <code>osmose.php</code> file in your app's config folder. 

In this file, you will find a ranges array that defines keys and their carbon ranges - d (day), w (week), m (month), y (year) have already been defined :). You can define more ranges here as you deem fit.

In order to filter using these ranges, osmose expects a <code>range</code> parameter in your url whose value is one of the ranges defined in the configuration file

```
/characters?range=m
```

This will filter characters who were created between the beginning and end of the month.

You can change the parameter name osmose expects you to give by overwriting the $range property in your filter class

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Filters;

use Agog\Osmose\Library\OsmoseFilter;
use Agog\Osmose\Library\Services\Contracts\OsmoseFilterInterface;

class CharacterFilter extends OsmoseFilter implements OsmoseFilterInterface
{
    protected $range = "dates";

    ...
}
```

By changing the $range property as shown above, our url will then be

```
/characters?dates=m
``` -->

## The Global Osmose Function

Version 1.2.0 introduces a global function, `osmose()`, that can automatically detect a model class from the filter. 

*To use this feature, you must publish osmose's configuration file by running;*

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Agog\Osmose\Providers\OsmoseServiceProvider"
```

To automatically detect models, the convention `${ModelName}Filter` should be followed when creating filters
For example, a filter named **CharacterFilter** will look for and automatically load a model called **Character**.

By default, osmose looks for models within the App namespace but this can be configured by changing the namespace's keyfrom within osmose's configuration file.

The `osmose()` function receives the filter's fully qualified class name and an optional model name.

It returns Eloquent's builder just like the sieve() method.

```php
public function index ()
{
    $characters = osmose(CharacterFilter::class)->get();
}
```

if the model name completely differs from the filter or if there isn't a single namespace under which models reside. e.g in a micro service architecture, then you can pass the model's fully qualified name as a second argument to the osmose function.

```php
public function index ()
{
    $characters = osmose(UserSieve::class, Character::class)->get();
}
```

If you have any feature requests, security vulnerabilities or just a good ol' thumbs up, dont hesitate to drop an email at [franciskisiara@gmail.com](mailto:franciskisiara@gmail.com) 

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by laravel's request validation. The name *osmose* comes from the biological word osmosis and how particles are able to *filter* through semi-permeable membranes. :)
